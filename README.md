<h1> Concept:
<h3> The "2 Minute Drill" is a football simulation game pertaining to the last two minutes of a football game, when your team is losing.
This situation often comes up in real football, and your team is not able to put points on the board, it will result in a loss. Ways of failing in 2 Minute Drill
are losing a fumble, throwing an interception, or turning the ball over on downs. 

Throwing the ball down field has its advantages. It get you closer to the goal line, but you run the risk of throwing an interception. Throwing it short mihgt get
some yards here and there, but you're going to have to throw it more often, which increases the risk.  Same with running the ball. The best game plan sometimes is to 
mix it up, and keep the defense on their heels.

<h1>Approach:
<h3>I had lofty goals in my approach to this game. First on my list was figuring out how to make the code work with a player vs a random computer using math.random. 
Still, not sure if that is going to completely work. Once I got the code working, it was on to the buttons. I have never created anything with working buttons before 
I was up for the challenge. After I could get the code and the buttons to work, it was CSS time.

<h1>Development Plan
<h3>Write the code and make sure it works: Keep it simple at first, then add more ideas to it, time pending.
<h3>Get the buttons to fire: make something happen when "clicked".
<h3>Get the buttons to fire correctly: make sure the right button is firing off the right function.
<h3>Css: I want the buttons to not only function, but to look decent.

<h1>MVP
<h3>I finally got a taste of having something in the wrong scope. After a few hours of racking my brain, I simply cut and pasted where the code needed to go.
<h3>Connecting the buttons and changing the screen. First time trying this.
<h3>No errors.

<h1>Stretch Goals
<h3>I really want this game to look cool and neat. I hope I can make the CSS look awesome.
<h3>Im hoping that after my code is reviewed it isnt too DRY.

<h1>Challenges
<h3>I think the biggest challenge for me was when i thought I was doing something correct, and it didnt work, I had a difficult time moving on from it.
I got stuck in more than a few instances and wasted valuable time not moving on. The scope problem was really frustrating for me. However, it really did feel
great when I solved it, and the code worked.
